**The Book Finder Web Application is a user-friendly tool designed to search for books using data from the Open Library API. Open Library is a vast platform that aims to create a web page for every book ever published, offering comprehensive information about books, authors, cover images, and subjects. This application allows users to search for books based on title, author, and publication year, providing detailed results such as the book's title, author(s), publication year, and cover image (if available).  

The application is built around a straightforward search interface with three input fields: title, author, and publication year. Users can enter one, two, or all three parameters to narrow down their search. For instance, if a user wants to find a book by a specific author, they can type in the author's name. If they are interested in books from a particular time period, they can search by publication year. Once the search is executed, the application sends a request to the Open Library API, which returns relevant book data in real time.  

A notable feature of the application is its sorting capability. After the search results are retrieved, users can choose how to organize them. They can sort the results by newest publications or oldest publications. This feature is useful when users are interested in finding the most recent books or want to explore older titles. It adds flexibility to the search experience and allows users to customize how they view the results.  

The results are displayed in a clear and organized manner. Each book entry includes its title, author(s), publication year, and a cover image (if available). If no books match the search criteria, the application displays a friendly message: "No books found." This ensures that users receive immediate feedback, making the application more interactive.
The user experience is simple and intuitive. With its clean design, the application is accessible to all users, regardless of technical expertise. The search process is quick and efficient, with results appearing almost immediately. Additionally, the application is responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktops and mobile devices.  

In conclusion, the Book Finder Web Application offers a simple and effective way to search for books using the Open Library API. With its sorting options and detailed results, it is a valuable tool for book enthusiasts, researchers, and anyone looking to discover new literature. **
